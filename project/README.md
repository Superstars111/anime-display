# Anime Display

This project is designed to display anime data (collected from AniList) in a single location.  
The goal is to give the sort of information you would want to know before watching the show, and to provide easy access to a selection
of multiple shows at once for easy comparison between options. Information about characters, staff, and other detailed information,
while useful in some settings, is not needed when deciding what show to watch, and therefore is not included in this program.
